- Initially, the AS01-ML01S module was connected the ATtiny as depicted below:
	Tiny MOSI -> AS01 MOSI
	Tiny MISO -> AS01 MISO
		   .
		   .
		   .

- The above connections were wrong. The MOSI and MISO ports needed to be switched in order for the AS01 to work well:
	Tiny MOSI -> AS01 MISO
	Tiny MISO -> AS01 MOSI
		   .
		   .
		   .	

- This makes sense because the output of the master MO, should be the input of the slave MI. 

- To fix the issue, the MOSI and MISO net ports in the schematic were flipped at the points where they connected to the ATtiny.
